                        In 9th grade, I was introduced to geometry and proofs , with their focus on terminology
                        and logical deduction.  It was the first time that I actively didn't like math.

                        Sometime during the course of that year, in a chemistry class, some reference to
                        an example or two of probability was made.  And, for whatever reason, <i>that</i>
                        idea grabbed me, much more than what we were covering in geometry.  By
                        the end of that class period, I had discovered Pascal's Triangle, which I
                        then went on to explore in much greater detail.

                        I brought my findings to my geometry teacher, who was a very nice person,
                        and she said, "Oh, that's Pascal's Triangle", and that was that.  I kind of let
                        the idea drop after finding that out.

                        I dabbled with my own math investigations over the course of high school,
                        including some very proto binomial transform stuff, but generally my head was
                        more focused on teaching myself programming in C and game programming.

                        Merging the two, at some point, I spent a few days writing and optimizing C programs to count primes
                        with trial division, the impetus of which I do not recall.  I do remember, however, 
                        coming up with the idea of wheel factorization while trying to speed up execution.
                        It was nothing extravagent - I'm mostly noting it to say the seeds were already planted.

                        It was really in 12th grade AP Calculus, though, that set the stage for what I would do later.
                        I liked calculus fine, although the role of analysis and proof still vexed me.
                        Additionally, when dealing with the infinite (as one does in calculus), numerical experiments often are suggestive
                        but not entirely reassuring (which is a great justification for rigorous proofs in the first
                        place, of course).

                    <div id="para">
                        Sometime around the time we were learning to regurgitate a proof of the
                        Fundamental Theory of Calculus, the text book we were using had an aside
                        about perfect numbers. It was just one of those short side articles math books often
                        have to add a bit of interest, as a break from the main topic they're covering.
                        And <i>that</i> grabbed me.  It was exactly the sort
                        of discrete question that was easy to compute (for small values, anyway),
                        but the pattern seemed so utterly elusive otherwise.  Was there some
                        methodical way for determining the sum of a whole number's divisors?

                        For the next two weeks, in that class and in the evening, I worked furiously,
                        trying to figure out a rule that determined the sum of the divisors of a
                        whole number.  During that time, my attention to the calculus class
                        evaporated, and my grade started sagging.

                    <div id="para">
                        But by the end of that two weeks, I had it.  I had figured out a way to
                        compute the sum of the divisors of a whole number.  If you got the number it in its
                        prime factored form, there was a specific product formula over its
                        prime factors that would compute that sum.  And I was thrilled!  I had
                        figured it out.

                    <div id="para">
                        I brought my findings to my calculus teacher, who was a very nice person,

                        showed me, in a book she scrounged up, the sum of divisors
                        expressed as the product formula I found.  I kind of let the idea drop after finding that out.

                        This last experience really left a mark on me.  I felt wired during
                        those two weeks, my mind just spinning in high gear as I turned the numbers this way
                        and that, trying to puzzle out where those sums came from (and then I got back up
                        to speed in calculus and did fine).

                        Despite these experiences, I never considered pursuing math vocationally.  I
                        participated in Math Counts and some high school AMS contests, and while I did okay,
                        I wasn't especially competitive even locally.  No one ever
                        really steered me in those directions too much.  And I didn't think about them
                        very much, either; I'd show up, but that exhausted my
                        interest in them.

                    <div id="para">
                        But really, the truth is, whatever it was that just grabbed me, about Pascal's Triangle,
                        and then grabbed me even harder, about perfect numbers and the divisor function,
                        just wasn't there in the puzzle collections you encounter in those contests.  I don't mean to be
                        dismissive in saying that, just that I lack whatever it is that draws people to those
                        kinds of contests and makes them invest in them and get so very competitive.
                        When I got sucked in to the permutations of the Pascal's triangle, or the world of
                        perfect numbers and the divisor function, there was something intensely exploratory about,
                        like I was navigating the edges of some unexplored continent -
                        this was something I never encountered in more formally structured
                        math spaces.  That truly profound sense of exploration was the thing.

                    <div id="para">
                        And besides, in high school, I was busy weighing a future of creative writing or one of
                        programming - and I ended up choosing programming.  Math really wasn't on my radar.
                        I don't think I had even an inkling of what people did with math.
