                        So, let's fast forward ahead 8 years.  In that time, I (deep breath) went to Georgia Tech
                        to learn how to program, dropped out after a year and a half to move across the country
                        and enter the video game industry as a game programmer and designer, got to be friends with some truly
                        talented people, shipped a bunch of high profile games that ended up on store shelves around the country,
                        grew into a much, much stronger
                        C programmer and debugger, collected enough stock option money to survive off of for a few years if I was
                        pathologically frugal, got profoundly burned out in that way
                        the video game industry has a habit of doing, returned to college at the University of Wisconsin for
                        poetry writing, and, finding it a bad fit for me, eventually dropped out again in the summer of 2001,
                        and I was just <i>adrift</i>.  I was living alone, off that stock option money, dabbling in some independent
                        game projects, starting to think about educational games, not really clear with what I was doing with myself.

                        In very late June, I was hanging out with a friend of mine, Roxanne.  She was, at the time, a grad student in neuroscience,
                        and we were hanging out at the co-op where she lived on the near, near East Side of Madison.  And we were
                        talking about random things.  As the conversation meandered, for reasons I don't recall,
                        Roxanne brought up the topic of prime numbers, and how peculiar and intriguing they were.  It was, I think,
                        intended as a fairly innocent conversation topic - I don't think Roxanne imagined she was dangling a bottle
                        of wine in front of someone with a strong proclivity towards alcoholism.  And the conversation didn't dwell there; we
                        moved on to whatever other random things science grad students and burned out game programmers living
                        off stock option money talk about.

                        But something about the conversation had lit a spark, had roused something dormant.  It had
                        been a long, long time since I'd even thought about my experience tracking down the
                        divisor function, 8 years before, in 12th grade.

                        Once I got home, almost immediately, I grabbed one of my game development notebooks and picked up where I'd left
                        off with the divisor function.  Despite the intervening years, the role prime factorization
                        had played for the divisor function still loomed large in my mind.

                        And so I <i>immediately</i> started trying out different ways of splitting up composite numbers
                        into smaller subgroups and then counting those groups.

                        The next couple weeks were an intense blur.  Although I dabbled a bit with a few programming experiments,
                        mostly, I just had a pen, my trusty TI-85 calculator, and a notebook, soon to be followed by a second.

                        Trekking in to the University of Wisconsin campus every day, I spent countless hours
                        in the comforting gloom of the student union's Rathskeller,
                        scribbling away in my notebooks with tables of my experiments.  I paced absent-mindedly
                        down the wooded lake shore path along Lake Mendota, from the Terrace out around University Bay,
                        my head racing with hunches about what I was seeing, and questions gelling as I strolled
                        for me to try once my walk was through.

                        Madison in the winter is brutal, but its summers can be glorious - and that summer was
                        glorious.  I spent yet more time, out behind the Student Union on the Terrance, working
                        through more experiments on my notebooks next to the lake, surrounded by happy throngs of Madisonians as I
                        tried to make out the calculations on my dim TI-85 screen in the brilliant midsummer sun.

                        that had brought me to Madison in the first place.

                        separate pages for annotating my notes in more fine-grained detail, but

                        Starting from here, I wrote a short C program to tally up how many of each category
