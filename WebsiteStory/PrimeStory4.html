                        In the course of the previous section's extended explorations, I realized
                        my intuitive counting was keeping me a little muddled.  I needed to 
                        formalize what I was doing more clearly.  And that led me to think
                        a bit more about counting generally.

                    <div id="para">
                        So I jotted down the following kinds of counting.

                        This is actually, in retrospect, an extremely interesting pair of papers, in a kind
                        of ironic, dramatic foreshadowing way that would recur again and again.  So I'll return
                        to these.

                    <div id="para">
                        The section labeled "Total Combinations" on the first page describes the
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisor_summatory_function">Divisor Summatory function</a>.
                        The form on the page highlights my computational orienation at the time; now I'd be much more likely
                        to describe the entry for 3, say, as the count of solutions to $a \cdot b \cdot c \le n$ where $a, b, c \ge 1$
                        and $a,b,c$ are all whole numbers.

                        summatory function closely related to the Divisor Summatory function that lacks
                        a standard name and standard notation.  In fact, I've never seen it referenced
                        anywhere.  And, again, now I'd be much more likely to describe the entry for 3, 
                        say, as the count of solutions to $a \cdot b \cdot c \le n$ where $a, b, c \ge 2$

                        The section labeled "Unique Combinations" on the second page is a counting

                        Now I'd be much more likely to describe the entry for 3,
                        say, as the count of solutions to $a \cdot b \cdot c \le n$ where $2 \le a \le b \le c$

                        My notational habits at this point, I think, hid what were really some straightforward
                        relationships between these three styles of counting.

                    <div id="para">
                        I spent a little time getting familiar with the Divisor Summatory function at this point.
                        I mapped it out for $D(n)$, and $D_3(n)$,

                        So I was familiar with it (this will matter hugely later),
                        but I didn't understand how riddled with important properties and symmetries it was,
                        and, coming from my very computationally oriented perspective, I was also aghast
                        at how slow it was to compute in the form I was looking at.

                    <div id="para">
                        Given the absurd lengths I've gone to since to speed up computing it, this feels
                        ironic in retrospect.

                    <div id="para">
                        With that said, though, in an important way, the sums I'm labeling "Unique Combinations"
                        also express, essentially, the same core idea that is present when using the Hyperbola method
                        to compute the Divisor Summatory function,
                        which I've also since spent a huge amount of time with, so I think I had some good
                        instincts here.
