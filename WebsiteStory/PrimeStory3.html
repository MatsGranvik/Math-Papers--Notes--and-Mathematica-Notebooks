                        I toyed briefly with chopping up the composites a different way and counting how many

                        $a^4 \cdot b \le n$, where $a > 1$ and $b > 1$, which on the following page is what

                        And so I decided instead to just count certain simpler sets of pairs / triplets / etc
                        of composities and see if I could notice any useful patterns as I went.

                        before the slash is the count of numbers $\le 100$ that have, say, 4 distinct prime factors (which is $12$).  
                        The corresponding number after the slash is the count of solutions to 
                        $a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d \le 100$, where $2 \le a \le b \le c \le d$ (here, $26$).

                        This kind of counting (which I did intuitively) would naturally count numbers in their prime

                        is $ 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7$, is only ever counted once, during the case of $4 \to$, as one solution
                        to $a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d \le 100$, with $2 \le a \le b \le c \le d$.  It would also be
                        counted a couple times for the cases of $2 \to$ and $3 \to$ (say as $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 14$).
                        The hope would be to find some way to identify that as a duplication without needing
                        to factor any numbers, which is very slow.

                        So that was intuitively why I counted this way.  It also had the virtue of being reasonable
                        for me to do by hand with my TI-85, at least for somewhat small numbers.

                        This set of ideas felt far more tractable to me - I needed to look at these duplications
                        (like the case of $12/26$) and find a way to reason about them, to count the
                        $26$ and then find a way to count that $14$ of them are duplicates.
