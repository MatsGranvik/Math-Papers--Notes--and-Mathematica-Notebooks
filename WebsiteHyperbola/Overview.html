                        I want to talk about the generalized number of divisors function and its connection
                        to identifying primes - but let's work our way up to this function.
                    </div>
                    <div id="para">
                        The most common number of divisors function is $d(n)$. It can be seen as
                        the count of solutions to $a \cdot b = n$, where $a$ and $b$ are whole numbers
                        $ > 0$ and where order matters.

                    <div id="para">
                        So, for example, 6 can be expressed as the product of the following
                        pairs of numbers: $1 \cdot 6$, $ 2 \cdot 3$, $ 3 \cdot 2$, and $ 6 \cdot 1$.  That
                        is four pairs of numbers, so $d(6)= 4$.

                    <div id="para">
                        Somewhat less commonly, $d(n)$ is generalized as $d_k(n)$, with $k$
                        a whole number.  Here, $d_3(n)$ is the count of solutions to $a \cdot b \cdot c = n$
                        where $a$, $b$, $c$ are whole numbers $>0$ and order matters.  Likewise,
                        $d_4(n)$ is the count of solutions to $a \cdot b \cdot d = n$
                        where $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ are whole numbers $>0$ and order matters.  And so
                        on.  So $d_k(n)$ has a nice, tidy combinatorial interpretation.

                        we can generalize $d(n)$ further, replacing whole number $k$ with a complex $z$.  And
                        we can define $d_z(n)$ quite cleanly, like so.

                        $$ \lim_{z \to 0} \frac{d_z( n )}{z} = \frac{1}{k} \textrm{ if } n=p^k, 0 \textrm{ otherwise }$$

                        But because we're interested specifically in prime counting, working with $d_z(n)$ is too fine-grained.
                        So let's define a summatory function of $d_z(n)$, labeled $D_z(n)$.  We can define it as

                        Well, by standard techniques, we can reverse the relationship between $\pi(n)$ and $\Pi(n)$,
                        by using moebius inversion.  I mentioned earlier that $d_{-1}(n)$ is the mobius function,
                        which is normally denoted as $\mu(n) = d_{-1}(n)$.  Then our equation for the count of primes is
                        $$ \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor \frac{\log n}{\log 2} \rfloor} \frac{\mu(k)}{k} \cdot
                        \Pi(n^{\frac{1}{k})  } = \pi( n ) $$

                        To help with your instincts, here is a graph showing both the count of primes function $\pi(x)$
                        and the weighted prime counting function $\Pi(x))$, going up to $x=1,000,000$.  If you zoom out with
                        the mousewheel and drag
                        the graph out a ways, say to x=500,000, you should see that they're very close and have
                        mostly similar behavior.

                        So, to recap: we have this generalized divisor summatory function, $D_z(n)$.
                        We can use $D_z(n)$ to compute a weighted prime counting function $\Pi(n)$.
                        We can in turn then use moebius inversion to get the count of primes $\pi(n)$
                        from $\Pi(n)$.  But so far, the only way we've seen to compute $D_z(n)$ is
                        by factoring all numbers $ < n$, which is slow.  So now we're ready to see
                        other ways of representing $D_z(n)$, which will lead immediately to other
                        ways of counting primes.
