                    So now on to my other approach, which is a bit slower but I'm convinced more promising
                    for future development.  
                    Computing $D_z(n)$ quickly hinges on finding and exploiting its natural symmetries.
                    The two approaches detailed below, which feel to me very natural, involve
                    the same symmetry captured in the Dirichlet hyperbola method.

                        Although this is the core identity for this counting approach, I do, of course, make use of some
                        more obvious combinatorial techniques to speed it up and to eliminate its memory consumption,
                        which can be seen in the C versions I'll link in just a second.
                        I first came up with this approach, more or less, back in early 2005.

                        One very interesting aspect of this approach is that it can have suprisingly good constant time performance,
                        especially for an algorithm that uses $O(n^\epsilon)$ memory.
                        In particular, it is vastly sped up by using wheel factorization, to an unusual degree.
                        Whereas the algorithm described in the previous page runs about 6 times faster when using
                        a wheel that discards numbers divisible by the first 7 primes (which is a very typical speed up for wheel
                        factorization), my best implementation of the above approach is sped up by something like a factor
                        of x5000 when using the same wheel, and has its big-O running time improved too.

                        algorithm.  You can look at those screenshots to get a sense, empirically, on how its execution
                        time grows with increasing input sizes.  I've asserted, empirically, that the non-wheel version
                        seems to run in something like $O(n \log n)$ time, and that my wheel version runs in something
                        like $O(n^\frac{4}{5} \log n)$, but that's just eyeballing the screenshots I just provided.

                        wheel (which uses about 45 Megs if I use a wheel that discards numbers divisible by the first 7 primes),
                        both versions of the algorithm use a neglible amount of memory - probably less than 1 k of RAM for
                        any reasonable input.

                        This memory bound hasn't actually been a goal of mine.  I'd much prefer to use memoization somehow to improve the

                        reason I'd like to get this published is the hope that someone else might have some ideas about
                        speeding it up with memoization.

                        Here's a different, very closely related approach, another hyperbola method variation.  In the previous section,
                        we introduced a new function, $D^\#_{k,y}(n)$ that we expressed $D_z(n)$ and $\Pi(n)$ in terms of, and
                        that $y$ parameter let us express $D^\#_{k,y}(n)$ recursively in terms of itself.  Here, we're going to instead
                        introduce a similar $y$ parameter to $D_z(n)$, which will let us express it in terms of itself.

                    <div id="para">
                        So let's introduce this generalization, $D_{z,y}(n)$.  If we define $f_k(n,j)$ as

                        Note that this is very similar to the the flattened definition we had for $D_z(n)$ in the previous

                        This approach is similar, in many ways, to the approach I described above, including
                        the fact that it runs much, much faster with wheel factorization applied to it.
                        Nevertheless, I've never developed any algorithms for counting primes with it that
                        have had quite the success as the one I detailed above. I'm mostly including it here because
                        I'm optimistic that it might provide some alternate interesting possibilities for memoization.

                        I actually have a lot more to say about this approach and why I'm optimistic about its
                        potential for memoization, but that's too complicated to include here.
