                    The Riemann Zeta Function is a very famous, very important function in math.  A few unanswered questions
                    about it have big prizes attached to them.  So let's suppose you're curious about it.

                    If you are, it's also notoriously tricky to understand without a background in some relatively challenging math.

                    Okay.  Well, masochist that I am, I'm setting myself an incredibly daunting - impossible, really - task for the
                    following few articles.  With an absolute MINIMUM of difficult math concepts, I'll try to provide a visual explanation for what the
                    Riemann Zeta Function is, at least from one perspective.  My approach will be visually oriented - if you have taken a first
                    year of calculus, you should be good for the actual math, for the most part.

                    any proofs, and I won't be using any esoteric-but-precise terminology.  The "arguments", such as they are, will be visual and intuitive,
                    mostly just interactive graphs and animations.  My hope is that by picking some unusual-but-illuminative examples,
                    the Zeta function won't be nearly so <i>mysterious</i>.  It'll still be hard to predict, but, if I succeed, you
                    should come away from this series of articles with some good, gut-level sense why it's 
                    the most natural thing in the world that it's hard to predict.

                    numbers.  This is fascinating and complicated stuff, without a doubt.

                        ever getting any smaller.  This can't possibly converge, you might very well argue.

                        larger and larger, the $y$ eventually looks like a quantized wave, the amplitude of which gets bigger and bigger.  It does not,
                        in fact, converge to a particular value.  But, there does seem to be a value the wave centered on.  And what is that value?
                        Visually, it's in the ballpark of six and a half.  If I claimed it was $6.51721...$, you wouldn't put up too much resistance, I bet.

                        you might concede, on the basis of the above graph, that the center part of $\cos(100 \log 1 )+\cos(100 \log 2 )

                        $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}x^z = z \cdot x^{z-1}$.  Its antiderivative is, in turn, just the inverse of
                        this: $\int x^z dx = \frac{x^{z+1}}{z+1}+C$.  (This works just fine for real numbers
                        raised to complex powers).  This lets us compute the definite integral $\int_{0}^x t^{ 100 i } dt$
                        as $\frac{x^{1+100 i}}{1+100 i} - \frac{0^{1+100 i}}{1+100 i}$.  That second term is just 0,

                        Finally, and most intriguingly, look at the range $x=13$ to $20$.  Here, the red sum is also doing a terrible job
                        approximating the smooth blue curve underneath it.  Nevertheless, the red sum is no longer behaving in a random fashion.
                        In fact, all of the samples seem biased in one direction, as though it were sampling a different, much lower frequency curve.

                        Okay.  So what do these three regions have to do with the sum ending up centered on $=6.51721...$?

                    <div id="para">
                        Well, in areas around $x = 500$ and beyond, the red sum approximates the smooth blue curve pretty well.  A good
                        hunch might be that the frequency at which the red sum samples the blue curve exceeds the frequency of the blue curve itself
                        in some important way.  Anyway, the center of the red sum already seems established by this point.  So this probably tells us
                        something about why the center converges, but not why it drifts originally.

                        On the other end of the graph, until $x= 6$, the red samples seem almost random.  This probably contributes to the
                        drift on the center, but in hard-to-discern-ways.

                        And between those two regions, centered on $x = 15$ and, to a lesser extent, $x = 8$, the red sum acts as though
                        it is sampling some other, much lower frequency curve than the blue curve it's actually sampling, causing the center of the red
                        sum to take a long shift in one vertical direction.

                        If you've ever worked with animation, image processing, or audio processing - anything involving sampling, either
                        temporally or spatially, really -  this might look naggingly familiar.  In fact, something like
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing">temporal aliasing</a> is broadly responsible for the center drifting generally,
                        something like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency"> Nyquist frequency</a> relates to why the center
                        stops drifting once the change in frequency of the continuous curve slows down enough, and the
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagon-wheel_effect">wagon-wheel effect</a> is related to why the areas at x=15 and
                        x=8 seem as though they are being sampled from some other continuous curve that is changing at a lower frequency (or see
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing?section=4#Sampling_sinusoidal_functions">here</a> too).

                        However, quite visibly, if we compare summing $t^{100 i}$ over the reals versus summing it over the whole

                        wave in the discrete case, and that continuous-to-discrete sampling error in this case is
                        $6.517210426253009... - 0.18128842533808529...\cdot i$ .

                        For the sake of intuition about this sampling error, let's connect it to another very familiar, much simpler concept.

                    <div id="para">
                        Earlier, I said you could think of $\sum_{t=1}^{\lfloor x \rfloor} \cos( 100 \log t )$ as being represented by a special two-part
                        number, with a non-converging wave part and a converging center part / sampling error.

                        The continuous equivalent, $\int_0^x \cos( 100 \log t ) \,dt$, on the other hand, is centered on 0.  It doesn't
                        have a sampling error (in fact, this is tautological, given the definition of Riemann integrals).

                        are all centered on 0 for <i>any</i> $A$ and $f$.  So, if we only ever worked with the
                        continuous case, we would never even think to trot out special two-part numbers, because it never, ever has
                        a center other than 0.  Only the discrete case requires special two-part numbers.

                        And then, later, you were taught about fractions and real numbers.  And in an instant, remainders disappeared, and division

                        nice, continuous real numbers.

                        error part, is rather similar in spirit, to the quotient and remainder of whole number division.  Don't
                        try to push this analogy too far, but I think this comparison might get you in the right frame of mind.
