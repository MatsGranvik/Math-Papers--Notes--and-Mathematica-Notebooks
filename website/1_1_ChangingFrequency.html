                        coincides with the Riemann Zeta Function for $\zeta(-f)$ at $f=100 i$ (think of $f$ as frequency   ).

                        huge vertical shifts caused by wagon-wheel-effect-style aliasing; the line marked 1hz shows up almost immediately, right
                        after $x=1$.  There's just a smattering of random samples until about $x=6$; then the offset center is established and a
                        fairly smooth approximation of the wave procedes.  It's actually a bit boring!

                        And sure enough, around $x=170$, the red sum does behave as a wave centered on the line
                        $y=-8.46309098852087$, just as expected.  As before, this happens shortly after a long descent centered around the 1hz line.

                    <div id="para">
                        This graph resembles the one for $\sum_{t = 1}^x t^{100 i}$ we explored before.  But I want to highlight
                        a few extra details.
                    </div>
                    <div id="para">
                        The magnitude of the vertical shifts is larger.  The vertical change around the 1hz line for
                        $\sum_{t = 1}^x t^{100 i}$ rose by about 4.3, from trough to peak.  Here, the shift descends by $13.1$, from $x=148$ to $x=172$.
                    </div>
                    <div id="para">
                        One new feature is long flat sections, between the big shifts around the 1, 2, 3 hz lines.  Look at from
                        $x=56$ to $73$, lying between the 3hz and 2hz lines.  Or look at from $x=85$ to $144$, lying between the 2hz and 1 hz lines.
                        During both sections, the red sum looks like a wave oscillating around a flat center line - roughly $y=2.8$ for the first range,
                        $y = .8$ for the second.  I'm tempted to speculate, on the basis of visual evidence, that ONLY the samples immediately around
                        the 1 hz or 2 hz lines contribute to the sampling error that leaves us, eventually, with a center of $y=-8.46309098852087...$.
                    </div>
                    <div id="para">
                        One last observation: the vertical shift at 1hz occurs over a larger set of samples than the one at 2 hz,
                        which itself takes place over a larger set of samples than the one at 3hz.  Thus, the shift at 1hz has a larger magnitude
                        than the one at 2hz, which is larger than the one at 3hz.  On the other hand, the vertical shift at 4hz, despite taking place
                        over a sample or two fewer than the shift at 3hz, appears greater in magnitude.  So vertical shifts don't inevitably grow in
                        magnitude the further right we go along the x axis.

                        Anyway, here are our other two graphs.  We're looking at more pronounced vertical shifts here; really pay
                        attention to what's happening at the 1, 2, 3, and 4 hz lines.

                        Compared to previous graphs we've explored, the vertical rises and falls are becoming much more substantial.
                        The vertical shift from x=1558 to 1624 sees a change of about $+53$.  Once again, the vertical shifts further right on the x axis
                        have, in general, much greater magnitudes.

                        On the other hand, the length of stretches unbroken by vertical changes are becoming longer.  Between the
                        2hz and 1hz lines is an extremely long stretch, from roughly x=818 to 1558, centered on roughly $y=-24.6$.

                        One phenomenon more visible here is a pre-oscillation in anticipation of later large vertical changes.  Look
                        especially at x=1430 to 1560, leading to the vertical shift at the 1hz line.  It resembles the

                        The hz lines chop up the number line in a harmonic fashion, which is easier to notice here.  So the 1hz line
                        is at x=1590, the 2hz line is at half that, at x=795, the 3hz line is at a third of that, at x=590, and so on.

                        the vertical shifts.  For example, from trough to peak at the 1hz line runs from x=1558 to 1624.  If we compare the 1hz line
                        for $\sum_{t = 1}^x t^{1000 i}$ and $\sum_{t = 1}^x t^{100 i}$ to the one here, it's visually clear that, proportionally, the
                        1hz vertical shift here is happening over a much smaller proportion of the samples.  It looks much less wide.

                        I'm impatient to get to the animations, but we ought to look at a few more examples.  Very quickly, here's
                        an example of a much, much, <i>much</i> larger frequency value.  I'm going to pass over this example without comment,
                        as it mainly demonstrates much more exaggerated examples of observations we just covered.

                        Previously, we saw, due to sampling errors, that the wave described by $\sum_{t = 1}^x t^{ 2 i }$ has a center with a
                        vertical offset of $y=0.3147257... - 0.231679... i$.  I hope that wasn't controvertial.

                        If I graphed a sum with an even lower frequency, $\sum_{t = 1}^x t^{ \frac{2}{10} i }$, the wave's
                        center would converge to <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=zeta(-.2i)">$-0.461411... - 0.176089... i$</a>.

                    <div id="para">
                        If I graphed an even lower frequency still, $\sum_{t = 1}^x t^{ \frac{2}{100} i }$, its center would
                        certainly be hard to detect visually, but I promise that that wave would have a vertical center that stabilized at
                        <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=zeta(-.02i)">$-0.4995988... - 0.01837076... i$</a>, all using the

                    <div id="para">
                        And that last value strongly suggests we might think of the present case as a degenerate wave, one with
                        a frequency of 0. As a degenerate wave, it doesn't oscillate around a center in any meaningful sense, of course, unlike all
                        our previous visually more straightforward examples.  But we can take the limit of the centers of all its non-degenerate
                        wave neighbors, and doing so indeed gives $-\frac{1}{2}$.

                    <div id="para">
                        So, just to restate, this is the concept.  In the first section, I introduced the hand-wavy concept of special
                        wave numbers with two parts, an oscillating wave and the center around which it oscillates.  And I suggested that if we sum
                        up whole numbers raised to various fixed complex powers, the limit of that summation can often be thought of as this kind
                        of wave number, and while the wave part of the number often doesn't converge (but hold that thought - we will revisit it
                        later), the center part DOES nearly always converge to a value.  And in the case of a power 0, the value the center of the
                        (degenerate) wave converges to is $-\frac{1}{2}$.

                    <script>graph1(); </script>
                    <div id="para">Here, the value of $-\frac{1}{2}$ seems to have no visual connection to the sum, as expected.</div>

                        Ah!  But here, finally, if we allow that the oscillating part of the sum is described by the degenerate
                        wave $\int_0^x \cos( 0 \log t ) \,dt$, then the connection finally does strongly, visually, suggest itself, doesn't it?
